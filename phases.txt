  Recommended Approach

  I suggest we proceed as follows:

  1. Approve phases 1-3 first (Foundation, Database, Template) ‚Äî these are prerequisites
  2. Code and review phases 1-3
  3. Then approve phases 4-7 (Admin, Routes, Views, SEO) ‚Äî core functionality
  4. Code and review phases 4-7
  5. Finally approve phases 8-10 (Performance, Testing, Deployment)

  This allows you to review architecture decisions early before we build too much on top.
